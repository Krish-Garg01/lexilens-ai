Of course. It's a great idea to update your `README.md` to reflect the final, polished state of your project. A good README is essential for showing off your work.

Here is a completely rewritten, professional `README.md` file that accurately represents all the features you've built and the final project structure.

# LexiLens AI ⚖️

**From Legal Chaos to Crystal Clarity.** LexiLens AI is a sophisticated, full-stack web application that leverages generative AI to deconstruct, analyze, and simplify complex legal documents. It empowers users to understand contracts, identify risks, and negotiate fairer terms with confidence.

This project features a secure FastAPI backend that handles user authentication, document processing, and AI analysis, coupled with a dynamic and responsive Streamlit frontend for a seamless user experience.

## Key Features

  * **Secure User Authentication:** JWT-based system for user registration and login, ensuring all documents are private and secure.
  * **Background Document Analysis:** Users can upload documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and receive an immediate response while the AI analysis runs as a background task, preventing UI timeouts.
  * **AI-Powered Risk Summary:** Utilizes the Google Gemini API and LangChain to perform a deep analysis of legal text, generating an overall risk score, a plain-English summary, and highlighting high-risk clauses.
  * **Interactive Document Q\&A:** A dedicated page where users can select an uploaded document and ask specific questions to get precise answers based on its content.
  * **"What-If" Scenario Analysis:** Allows users to explore hypothetical situations against their documents to understand potential outcomes and risks.
  * **AI Clause Negotiator:** For any high-risk clause, users can generate fairer, more balanced alternative wording with a single click, empowering them to take action.
  * **Modern UI/UX:** A professional, dark-themed interface built with Streamlit, featuring a multi-page design, custom styling, and a responsive dashboard.
  * **Cloud-Native & Ready to Deploy:** The application is structured for a multi-service deployment on modern cloud platforms like Render or Google Cloud.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | Streamlit | For building the interactive web application interface in pure Python. |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | A high-performance Python framework for building the robust, asynchronous API. |
| **AI Model** | Google Gemini API | The core generative AI engine for all analysis, summarization, and negotiation tasks. |
| **AI Framework** | LangChain | Manages prompts, chains, and the overall AI logic for interacting with the Gemini API. |
| **Database**| Supabase (PostgreSQL) | A cloud-based relational database for storing user and document data, with a local SQLite fallback. |
| **PDF Processing** | PyMuPDF | A reliable library for extracting text from uploaded PDF documents. |
| **Authentication** | JWT & Passlib | For secure, standard token-based user authentication and password hashing. |
| **Deployment** | Gunicorn | A production-ready WSGI server for running the FastAPI backend in a live environment. |

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * A Google Gemini API Key
  * A Supabase account and database URL (or use the built-in SQLite fallback)

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd lexilens-gen-ai-project
    ```
2.  **Set up environment variables:**
      * Create a file named `.env` in the root directory (`lexilens-gen-ai-project/`).
      * Add your secret keys to this file:
        ```
        GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
        SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:[YOUR-PASSWORD]@[YOUR-HOST]:5432/postgres"
        ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
      * Install backend dependencies: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`
      * Install frontend dependencies: `pip install -r streamlit_app/requirements.txt`

### Running the Application Locally

You need to run the backend and frontend simultaneously in two separate terminals from the **root directory**.

  * **Terminal 1: Run the Backend**
    ```bash
    uvicorn backend.main:app --reload
    ```
  * **Terminal 2: Run the Frontend**
    ```bash
    streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
    ```

You can now access the frontend at `http://localhost:8501`.
