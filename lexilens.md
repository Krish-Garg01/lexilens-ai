## Technology Stack

This platform is designed with a modern, scalable, and secure Python-centric technology stack to handle the demanding requirements of AI processing, a professional user experience, and a commercial API.

| Component | Technology Recommendation | Purpose & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | **Python** | The standard for AI; vast library support and a mature ecosystem for web APIs. |
| **Frontend** | **React / Next.js** | Essential for building the professional, interactive dashboard where users will manage documents, view analytics, and **generate/manage their API keys**. |
| **Backend** | **FastAPI** | High-performance and perfect for building APIs. It **automatically generates interactive API documentation (Swagger UI)**, which is crucial for developers who will use your service. |
| **API Authentication** | **API Keys & JWTs** | Use **API Keys** for external developers accessing your API and **JWTs** (JSON Web Tokens) for securing your own web application's user sessions. |
| **Async Task Queue** | **Celery & Redis** | **Critical for your API**. Document analysis can be slow. Your API will receive a document, start a background job with Celery, and immediately return a `task_id`. The client then polls a results endpoint to get the analysis when it's done. |
| **Primary Database** | **PostgreSQL** | A robust database to store user information, document metadata, hashed API keys, and subscription status. |
| **Payments & Billing** | **Stripe** | The industry standard for handling payments and subscriptions. Stripe's API makes it easy to implement usage-based billing for your API clients (e.g., billing per document or per page). |
| **AI Model** | **Gemini API / OpenAI API** | The core generative AI engine that your backend will call to perform the analysis. |
| **AI Framework** | **LangChain** | The essential Python library for managing prompts, structuring AI logic, and connecting all the AI components together in a coherent system. |
| **PDF Processing** | **PyMuPDF** & **pdfplumber** | A reliable primary library (PyMuPDF) with a fallback (pdfplumber) for handling a wide variety of PDF structures and handling errors gracefully. |
| **Vector DB (RAG)** | **ChromaDB / Weaviate** | ChromaDB is excellent for self-hosting. Weaviate or Pinecone are more scalable managed options suitable for a production API that needs to handle many documents. |
| **Deployment** | **Docker & Docker Compose** | For containerizing your entire application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, Celery workers, Redis) for consistent and scalable deployment to any cloud provider (AWS, GCP, etc.). |
